title: About me
---

My name is Mathias. I live in Odense and study AP Computer Science. I also work a student job at a small regional bank, where I switch between administrative, economical and IT-related tasks.

I use this website to document my fourth semester of AP Computer Science, where my group and I collaborate with a company to develop a user-to-user translation application.

Feel free to reach out!
